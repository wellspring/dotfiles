Inspired by & adapted script from midnighttokerkate's [Circle Volume Indicator](http://www.macosxtips.co.uk/geeklets/system/circle-volume-indicator/)

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

1.	Move DiskCapacityMeter folder to your preferred directory, eg to **Documents/Geektool/**

2.	Edit the PATH variable in DCM.scpt to match the path of the DiskCapacityMeter folder,
	eg **/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Documents/GeekTool/DiskCapacityMeter/**

3.	Open GeekTool/NerdTool and set up a shell geeklet to do:

	`osascript /PATH/DCM.scpt`

	Where PATH is the path from step 2.

4.	Then set up an image geeklet with image:

	`file://localhost/PATH/temp.png`

	Where PATH is the path from step 2. I placed the image geeklet bottom center of my screen and the 'blind' shell geeklet right under it. This is not ideal and somebody could make all this work without AppleScriptâ€¦ but hey, it works! 

5. 	Set refresh rate of the geeklets to what you like, I prefer 3600 seconds.
