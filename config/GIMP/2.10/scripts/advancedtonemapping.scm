; Advanced Tone Mapping is a script for The GIMP
;
; Reduce global contrast while increasing local contrast and shadow/highlight
; detail.
;
; Advanced Tone Mapping is a fork/continuation of Tonemapping script
; originally written by David Meiklejohn and Harry Phillips.
; The 2.0 version was created by Vit 'tasuki' Brunner.
;
; The script is located in menu "<Image> / Filters / Enhance"
; Last changed: 13 June 2008
;
; --------------------------------------------------------------------
;  
; Changelog:
;  Version 2.0 codename 'tasuki' (Friday the 13th, June 2008)
;    - Moved the script to Filters/Enhance where it IMHO belongs
;    - Removed result flattening
;    - Changed the amount of Gauss-blur to be in %Â of image size
;    - Added option to set the original Gauss-blurred layer's opacity
;      (default staying 75)
;    - Added option to set the number of times the merged layer is copied
;    - The original layer is preserved. The script adds one non-transparent
;      layer with all the changes in it, which is named according to
;      the parameters the script was called with (looks messy but is handy)
;
;  Version 1.4 (8th August 2007)
;    - Added option to flatten the result
;
;  Version 1.3 (5th August 2007)
;    - Added GPL3 licence 
;    - Menu location at the top of the script
;    - Removed the "script-fu-menu-register" section
; 
;  Version 1.2
;    - Made the script compatible with GIMP 2.3
