;; A script that compare images.
;;
;; This script load two images files and create:
;;   - a layer "ref" with the first image
;;   - a layer "out" with the second image
;;   - a layer "col-diff" containing white pixels where colors are
;;     different between the two images
;;   - a layer "alpha-diff" containing white pixels where alpha is
;;     different between the two images
;;   - a layer "diff" containing white pixel when either colors or
;;     alpha are different
;;   - an optional layer "grown-diff" where the white regions in 
;;     "diff" layer have grown by a given amount of pixels
