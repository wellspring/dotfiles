; DESCRIPTION:
;
; Converts a square or rectangular image into a Fibonacci spiral
; (similar to a "golden spiral" -- the fine distinctions are discussed
; under the wikipedia entry on Golden spiral
; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_spiral]) by making smaller
; copies of the image, rotating them, and arranging them into a spiral
; tiling.  If the initial image is square, then the tiling has no
; overlap; for a rectangular image, the user can specify a blending mode
; for how the overlap is treated.
;
; Works best if the image has a Fibonacci number of pixels as width
; and height (and this is especially true if the original image is a
; square).  The user can toggle an automatic rescaling to the nearest
; Fibonacci length (smaller than or equal to the original size).
;
; Located in menu "<Image> / Filters / theilr / Fibonacci Spiral"
;
; USAGE NOTES:
;
;   The user can specify the angle (in 90 degree increments, measured
;   clockwise) that the square is turned with each reduction in size.
;   To get the spiral effect, you'll probably want to use the default
;   value of 90, or possibly 270.
;
;   The user can specify the quadrant where the center of the spiral
;   well end up.  Default is lower right.  
;
;   Much of the rescaling, etc, is based on image size, not layer size.
;   So if canvas and current layer are not the same size, there's no
;   telling what will actually happen.
;
;   If a there is a selection, it is ignored.
;
;   Each rescaled rectangle/square is in a different layer, so you'll
;   probably want to follow up by merging all layers.
;
; BUGS:
;   Although this permits various blending modes and opacities, I
;   find I almost always prefer normal mode and 100-percent opacity.
;   In other words, you might as well be working with square images.
;
;   There's no good way to put borders around each of the squares that
;   goes into the spiral; eg, if you give the original square a dark
;   border, it gets lost in the cubic rescaling after just a few
;   generations.
;
; SCRIPT SUMMARY:
;   Prepare Image by making it Golden Landscape Rectangle
;     Flip/flop image, if needed, so that spiral center 
;       ends up in desired quadrant
;     Rotate, if necessary, so image is landscape
;     Optionally rescale the image to have Fibonacci width and height
;     If square, make into a landscape-mode golden rectangle
;
;   Loop:
;      Copy layer, then:
;       reduce size by factor of golden ratio[*]
;       possibly rotate layer
;       move layer to appropriate position on the spiral
;   Repeat until there's no more room.
;
;   Un-rotate, and Un-flip/flop 
;
;   [*] note, this is not done by multiplying or dividing, but
;       by continually subtacting short from long to get shorter,
;       until the shorter is zero (or less).  then you stop.
